## Current/Recent Projects

### FEC

* [HR Front End Capstone](https://github.com/IslandBois/FEC)

### SDC
> Moving on from the front end, this new project was to build an API server and backend for the previous front end project. I chose to go with a different section of the app than I had worked on in the front end.
> After getting the database schema built and routes set up we started really stress testing the performance with help from tools like K6.
> After learning about Docker and deploying, the rest of the project came down to scaling the app...

### MyTrainingLogApp
> On the side and for fun, I am working on my own training log app to log my workouts...
> I began with creating database schemas in MongoDB and PostgreSQL to store eventual users, workouts, and exercises.
